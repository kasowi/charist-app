# CHARIST

Capstone project for the neue fische Java bootcamp
by Katharina-Sophie Winkler


Charist is an app to find NGOs and social institutions around the world by the cause they are working on. Users can search for causes or regions, 
find NGOs and build their own "charity portfolio" to administer donations to different causes or NGOs (one time or recurring).
